Students learned practical skills like time management and goal setting, connected with peers and mentors, and aligned their personal journeys with TTI's mission to uplift and empower. Old scholarship beneficiaries shared their experiences with new students, preparing them for tertiary education, life changes and expectations. This has played a significant role in preparing our new students for the transition to an urban environment, which is vastly different from the rural setting they were accustomed to. We used this opportunity to share important scholarship guidelines and communication protocols to ensure smooth coordination between the office, students, and institutions. During these engagements, we also reassured our students that the office is fully committed to offering psychosocial support to anyone who may need it.We deeply value our scholarship program, not only as a means of academic support but as a holistic journey. Our goal is to nurture students who are mentally healthy, focused, and equipped with the skills and mindset to thrive in the world of work and beyond.

In the first quarter of 2025, a total of 7,512 tomato plants were planted, with the first harvest in June expected to generate over $6,000 USD. During the 2nd quarter, an additional 6,000 tomato plants and potatoes were planted, expected harvest will be in September. These agricultural initiatives, along with other crop projects, are creating a vital income stream for the schools, fostering entrepreneurship, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of our projects. It is exciting that Chivakanenyama Secondary has started the construction of a new block using the proceeds from the garden irrigation project. We have seen community involvement in the project as they have provided locally available resources. This has marked a groundbreaking achievement and it stands as a motivation to other schools. We expect completion of the block by November 2025.",
